Being a challenging project from business perspective I was bit concerned about the team formation. However my concerns were short-lived once results started to come in. Vipul was one of those team members who despite of being a newbie learned the technologies quickly and delivered beyond the limits. He played a role of all-rounder in the team as and when project demanded. Vipul, instead of being reactive, is a proactive person who setups benchmarks for fellow team members in terms of learning, productivity, process compliance etc. He is a very easy going person who believes in helping his team members and raises team spirits to new heights. His ability to accept new responsibilities and adapt to the situations is praiseworthy.I see a bright future in front of him and wish all the best.",
