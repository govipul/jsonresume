Statement:
Your resume/CV in JSON format and a parser for the resume so it can be displayed.
We’d like you to submit your resume in JSON format, and have an app consume the JSON data and display it. It can be done on web, mobile, or any platform or language that you’re most familiar with. You can display it any way you think would be impressive: good typography, visualizations, etc.
Don’t worry if your design is not as good as you’d like; we’re mostly interested in how you parse the JSON you made and the pretty rendering is just a bonus.
